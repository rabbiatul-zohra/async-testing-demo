# Lifecycle Methods and Hooks in React
This is a very basic app to demonstrate the use of `useState`, `useEffect` and `useContext` hooks during a lecture, and so is far from a complete or beautiful application.

## Purpose

Created using `create-react-app`, it uses the [brewdog API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) as a source of data to fetch a list of beers or a random one, and includes a dark theme toggle.

## Installation

Clone down the repo and run
```
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
NOTE: tests are not completed as this is merely a demonstration to be run through during a lecture

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
